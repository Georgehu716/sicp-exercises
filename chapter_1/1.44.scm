;; Exercise 1.44: The idea of smoothing a function is an
;; important concept in signal processing. If f is a function and d x is
;; some small number, then the smoothed version of f is the function
;; whose value at a point x is the average of f ( x âˆ’ d x ) , f ( x ) ,
;; and f ( x + d x ) . Write a procedure smooth that takes as input a
;; procedure that computes f and returns a procedure that computes the
;; smoothed f . It is sometimes valuable to repeatedly smooth a
;; function (that is, smooth the smoothed function, and so on) to obtain
;; the n-fold smoothed function. Show how to generate the n-fold smoothed
;; function of any given function using smooth and repeated from Exercise
;; 1.43.
