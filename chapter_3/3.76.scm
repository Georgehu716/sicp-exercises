;;  Exercise 3.76: Eva Lu Ator has a criticism of Louisâ€™s approach in
;;  Exercise 3.75. The program he wrote is not modular, because it
;;  intermixes the operation of smoothing with the zero-crossing
;;  extraction. For example, the extractor should not have to be
;;  changed if Alyssa finds a better way to condition her input
;;  signal. Help Louis by writing a procedure smooth that takes a
;;  stream as input and produces a stream in which each element is the
;;  average of two successive input stream elements. Then use smooth
;;  as a component to implement the zero-crossing detector in a more
;;  modular style.
